# Learning Python

I'm on my journey to become a dev, this repository is meant to reocord my progress while I learn more and more about this language.
In this repository there are some codes, exercise and challenges tha I have done.

## What you can expect finding here

This repository is divide in folders, each one with a different topic and difficult level. althoug the folders cover a wide range of topics, they are espcific to the main libraris from python. So, If you want to learn about SQL with Python, you can cehck my other repositoy [here](https://github.com/Lirovsk/python_sql).

## About a more complex project

I have a not finished project tha I'm working on, is basic a table game created in the computer using Python. In this porject I hav used more of my knowledge abou classes and objects, so if you want to see it, you can check it [The_Resistence](https://github.com/Lirovsk/The_Resistence).

### Note

Since a lot of codes in this repo are not commented, I'll be adding comments to them as I have time. If you have any question about any code, feel free to ask me.
