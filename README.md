# Learning Python

I'm on my journey to become a dev, this repository is meant to reocord my progress while I learn more and more about this language.
In this repository there are some codes, exercise and challenges tha I have done.

## What you can expect finding here

This repository is divide in folders, each one with a different topic and difficult level. althoug the folders cover a wide range of topics, they are espcific to the main libraris from python. So, If you want to learn about SQL with Python, you can cehck my other repositoy [here](https://github.com/Lirovsk/python_sql).

### Note

Since a lot of codes in this repo are not commented, I'll be adding comments to them as I have time. If you have any question about any code, feel free to ask me.
